# Activity 26: CSS FLEX
This activity focuses on developing responsive layouts for various cases using CSS Flexbox. The activity  is in five parts and each part includes a different layout using Flexbox developed in HTML:
1. Product Layout - this section shows product images, their names, and prices, and an Add to Cart button for each product is shown in a grid format. Products are designed to be flexibly spaced making use of the responsive nature of css flexbox.
