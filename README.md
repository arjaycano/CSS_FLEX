# Activity 26: CSS FLEX
This activity focuses on developing responsive layouts for various cases using CSS Flex. The activity  is in five parts and each part includes a different layout using Flex developed in HTML:
1. Product Layout - this section shows product images, their names, and prices, and an Add to Cart button for each product is shown in a grid format. Products are designed to be flexibly spaced making use of the responsive nature of css flex.

2. Employee Cards - this section includes information about employees in the form of descriptions enclosed in cards. This includes such information as the employee’s picture, his or her name, and job title. CSS Flex works for this layout even on different devices and screen sizes.

3. Student Profiles - this page appears with students’ profile pictures, full names, courses, and years written on student card templates. Cards are also responsive with the help of CSS flex and when the screen gets smaller they wrap around.
